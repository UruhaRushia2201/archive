This deserves a Part Deux also, because the stream was so fun too.

Also, this marks a return to ""Animal crossing"" later of too much time without playing and first time watching the Pink-purple haired Rushia playing this game.

As Additional point... the previous ""Animal Crossing"" stream at 2020 May 31st (Now hidden) was the second Rushia's stream I watched. Too many memories bring me from this stream, because it was my second time when I donated at Superchat, in this time I've got noticed 2 times as ""Nekusuzeru-san"""
