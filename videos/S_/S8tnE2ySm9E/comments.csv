UgzCNr22fYZncFwZJDt4AaABAg,1617235200,Nexcell Pride,3,"Wow, an intense stream ever :_ちょうちょ:
BGM Opening: Summer Triangle.

This time, Rushia-daitenshi didn't get at least the 3rd place than previous streams of this game, but despite the result she at least seems too calm and with a good sense of humor.

Who said about the Necromancers can't laugh, smile or grin? If that was true, so Rushia broke her character's shell.
This makes it ever closer to those who see her. :_きゅん:

And ""Supaachaato Orei Time"" was too long and more interesting, because Rushia told us about Yesterday's Cross-collab between Hololive and 2434. It was pure Daiya 💎

And... Personally talking... Well, nobody asked me about one Superchat with the following message: ""Stop the jokes. Not pettan, not Boing boing, she's just an Angel enclosed inside a Necromancer body""
Please forgive me about the previous point, but you can ask me already... 😳❤️"
