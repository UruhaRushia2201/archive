UgwXllGy3Z61DwEKbMh4AaABAg,1617235200,Delia Pizarra,0,"Hey rushia!!

Here's a tip to open the iron door without a mistake , I think??.

You might also know this




If you want to open the iron door ,the iron door can be opened at observers, levers, pressure plates, bottons,and redstone , IF you know how redstone connection works if you know it you might get it master easily but in the end it's hard.

You can practice it on creative mode to understand it 

Second tip!!!

Pls don't bring a bucket of water while opening the iron door because an iron door can't be opened at bare hands as I already said the tip from the first , I think? The other doors that are easy to open you can get in with a bucket of water , I think? 

Im so sorry I just forgot ,and sorry for the long comment , have a nice day or night ,Thats it I hope you understand me."

UgxU7XSdUoXmIiQZy1h4AaABAg,1617235200,Nexcell Pride,5,"A wonderful stream today (Yesterday to today in Japanese time) :_ちょうちょ::_るんるん:

Well... Some Highlights of that great Stream, and one of most longest and passionated. 

0:00:00 Opening (""Summer Triangle"" by Dova Syndrome's BGM Library)

0:02:58 Stream start.

0:03:11 Konrushi... But something suceeding with Rushia-daitenshi. Maybe needed our accompaniment. Not maybe... Already. 

0:04:01 Holomembers at Holoserver:
— Meru-chan (Hololive 1st Generation member)
— Pekora-san and Noel-san (Holofantasy/Hololive 3rd Generation members)
— Ollie-chan (Holoindo/HoloID/Hololive Indonesia 2nd Generation member)

0:08:28 Let's Start!

0:10:08 Change BGM (Same as Minecraft streams since late December 2020)

0:11:31 Inventory and preparatives for journey

0:20:07 Cat advertising about creepers and endermen?

0:21:04 Archery sniping against incoming zombies and creepers.

0:21:41 A present? And it seems, signed by Flare-san (Holofantasy/Hololive 3rd Generation Member)

0:31:00 it seems Holoserver was too expanded.

0:32:47 ""Usada's Trade Center"" (I can no longer tell who from clerks is the so-called Fandead Joseph) 

0:39:42 and 0:42:59 Enchantement for new gears. (The previous ones where lost with Magma in one stream)

0:47:15 Start Journey

0:49:29 Ender chest inventory. (I didn't noticed it: The ""Tsurupettachi Kai"" was already there, I though it was lost with the Magma. That special pickaxe is most recognizable for No Stamina Bar)

0:50:50 Start the trident chase.

0:52:25 Also Magma Rocks are underwater.

0:53:41 Found gold

0:55:34 Only an axe and meat found at that chest.

Starting that moment, chase starts... From all zombies few are armed with tridents, but a few percentage of them have original tridents.
During that chase, also a chicken (or duck) and Shirokuma were found at icebergs, but the Yabai moment was the mistake with command at 1:53:13, causing polar bear hit. Later, polar bear escaped for chasing character player. 

2:18:04 Weather goes complicated for mission, but mission is underwater. The yabai moment is Raiden apparition (Raiden means Thunder and Lightning, is the both elements God at Oriental Myth, but also refers to Kaminari, which stands Lightning in japanese)
The major worrying is... Water is electricity conducter. 

2:50:57 Later of too many tries, finally a second trident was obtained. Euphory from Rushia-daitenshi.

It seems, for some reason the Rainy weather goes with Rushia at these missions.

Her surprise scream also was accompanied with tears of joy.

Also, her catchphrase ""Aa Supacha Arigatou Gozaimasu"" was taking that space.

2:52:57 Changing BGM:
— The first one: ""Supaachaato Orei Time"" BGM from early October 2020 until late November 2020.
— The second one: Unused. 
— The third one: ""Supacha Yomi Time"" from 2019 September 11th (Second ""RingFit Adventure"" stream). Also that BGM made very short cameos at 2020 September 12th (""Itsumo Arigatou"", delivered after that accidented ""FallGuys"" stream) and 2020 September 29th (""Ouchi 3D""/""3D at Home"") streams. 
— The fourth and definitive: From Zatsudan and pendant ""Supaachaato Orei Time"" stream at 2020 August 9th, delivered after that ""Shadow Corridor"" stream interrupted by Towa's Birthday.

The mentioned BGM sounded like ""Mission Accomplished, I'm happy and already returning at home""
Best part with that selected BGM was at 3:00:15, with the sunset and after when night rises up.
A very romantic and beautiful moment.
At 3:02:02 and fitting with selected BGM, Rain falls at Holoserver (Principal)
Also a romantic moment, mixed with Rushia-daitenshi's calm voice.
— Personally talking, That moment remembered me to ""Tanabataʼs Minecraft"" delivery (2020 July 7th), when after launching fireworks, changed BGM (Was another BGM at piano) and started to rain at Holoserver. —

Now returning to highlights... 

3:03:20 Inventory review again.

3:05:20 Name for this new trident... It seems Rushia-daitenshi doesn't like joking about her own physical, but also she only makes jokes herself at that point to naming her first special pickaxe as ""Tsurupettachi"" and the first trident as ""Boindento""... (Personal talking: Wakaranai, sorry sorry)

3:05:32 Name selected: ""Tsuruginomai""

3:06:43 Changed BGM again. It's the BGM used at last minutes of normal stream at ""Yasuhati"" gameplay. (2020 July 28th)
At that moment meanwhile it was raining at Holoserver and Rushia-daitenshi was inside home, sounded like... Hot cocoa time... Or tea... Coffee... Well... 

3:09:10 Magma Strider captured at previous Minecraft delivery.

3:16:09 Weather is sunny.

3:16:47 Again Usada's Trade Center.

3:19:20 Going to another dimension in order to farming zombies and creepers and obtaining level up. (Requires Level 30 for enchanting the ""Tsuruginomai"")

3:35:29 Return to home.

3:45:46 Ollie-chan (Holoindo 2nd Generation member) appears.

3:51:24 Meanwhile Rushia-daitenshi tried to kill creeper, Ollie-chan crosses in the middle and gets shot. Fortunately Ollie-chan's items are still there and she respawns... Rushia made necromancy.

3:55:31 Ollie-chan tried to defeat an Enderman without any gear. Again gets killed, Rushia was watching in fact of non commiting same error of cross fire.
Fortunately, Ollie-chan is respawned again. 

3:57:11 Last moment with Ollie-chan before returning at home.

3:58:53 Last chat. Oyasumi (Good Night)

4:00:37 and 4:02:43 Sakura's Trade Center.

4:03:49 ""I'm at home""

4:03:59 and 4:06:00 ""Tsuruginomai"" upgrading.

Later of that, extra battles and covering battling holes at ground.

Also was Squid chase... (Personally talking, at that hour I was lunching... Fried squids, believe it or not... Well, seafood generally)

4:26:25 Showing ""Tsuruginomai"" trident to ""Puchipastel"" (Magma Strider), photo session and ending normal stream. Otsurushi~ :_ちょうちょ:

4:29:22 Ending: ""Enchanting waltz ending"" (Rushia's delivery ending) :_ハート:

4:30:59 ""Supaachaato Orei Time""
Scrolling message says: ""Reading and Thanking Supaachaato. Today's Stream is Ended""

""Supaachaato Orei Time"" Logo debuted at April aproximately. Scrolling text premiered at August 2020 along with ""Supacha Yomi Time"" logo. Starting early October 2020, ""Supacha Yomi Time"" logo disappeared, leaving only scrolling message, indicating the return of ""Supaachaato Orei Time"", but logo returned at early December 2020.

Also a time for hot cocoa due to cold weather.

At 4:50:48, Message sighted at LiveChat: ""Your red eyes are very captivating. I Love it!!!"" 
It's clearly the charming of Yasuyuki-sensei's girls. 

Personal Marks:
5:15:36 For a Friend... :_サイリウム碧: :_サイリウム紫: (I can't know if he was noticed at another moment of this section)
