UgzjSe1VG8GDpg6kZw14AaABAg.9DZDxoTqQ-E9DuwpFpbcP5,1617235200,Mike Bather,0, @Jun wei Zhu  Then what really happened then
UgzjSe1VG8GDpg6kZw14AaABAg.9DZDxoTqQ-E9Dv3RCRQUEU,1617235200,Jun wei Zhu,0," @Mike Bather  viewers  asked Rushia whether she'll be okay with the time(5-10mins before holoEN debut) and reminded her that the debut of holoEN was about to begin and when she asked about the superchats, they responded that it may be better to do it next time. They did so out of concern because Rushia had frequently overlapped important streams(think birthday streams etc) before.
Rushia readily said okay actually, but since many other viewers were also telling her it was fine to continue, she started to hesitate. She decided to ask her manager again. Her manager didn't respond though, probably because it was around 8pm or just busy.
Rushia mentioned while waiting that she already asked before because it bothered her and got the okay already. She then decided to continue  for about 15 mins and couldn't handle the stress anymore and decided to stop after all. The viewers were pretty well behaved and understanding during the entire 15 mins.
If you've seen the clip before, you'll start to notice the translator removed a lot of parts that made context to what Rushia said there."

Also is the first time with Pink-purple haired Rushia playing Minecraft. (In that Tanabata stream, Rushia suddenly returned at green haired form) 
The underground quest was so exhaustive, Rushia-hime excavated until arriving to other homes.
Meanwhile outside, nothing changed... the same colorful lights at trees from that stream.

Also... Mission Completed about the 50 Diamonds... well, Rushia-hime collected 10 more. Additionally, Aqua-san was Online and Rushia gave the 10 remaining diamonds."

予想の半分以下の時間で50個達成して驚いた。



堀り返すべきじゃないかと思ってたんですが、少しその話が出たので新参ながら申し上げます。

昨日の件で心配していたんですがこの配信見て安心しました。
Twitterやってないから自身の考えを言う機会があまりありませんが、皆様と同じくこれからもサポートしていく所存です。
スパチャがメインになると思いますが、スパチャやメンバー加入だけがサポートじゃないし皆で楽しくやっていきましょう。"
