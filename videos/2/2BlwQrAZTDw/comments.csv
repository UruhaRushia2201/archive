Ugwdrnuvxwl6atxXbDh4AaABAg,1617235200,Kekitus,32,"I'm glad she played it her own way instead of just following ""how you're supposed to play it"". 

People sometimes forget why they ended up falling in love with this game in the first place. Undertale isn't that much of a revolutionary gaming experience : though the gameplay is nice, it's nothing out of the extraordinary either.

What makes it such a wonderful game is the psychological experience and the emotional journey you get by playing it blindly. After all, you only ever get to really experience the guilt of Sans' judgement by making your own choices. 

I'm glad Rushia got to experience the bad after taste left after a neutral route, this horrible feeling of having to kill Asgore who doesn't even want to look at you in the eye because he himself is crushed by his own guilt... And all of that, just after Sans judged you and told you how much of a terrible human you are.  

In the end, people tend to forget it, but the ""right way"" to play this game is without being told what the right way of playing it is."

UgxTVayXx4r_B4i8T0B4AaABAg.9K-4Zrf4MIz9K3GzwsM2y6,1617235200,Newbtuber,0, @Cage Nightwind  most people who play this game does not expect this kind of depth from this game. The poor graphic also makes making these sort of choices easy. Which is why the Sans judgement scene is what suppose to bring you full circle to question your consequences. She played the game EXACTLY how you are suppose. Probably one of the best play through ever. The one minute of silence when Sans told her she was a brother kill made her completely shocked and went speechless truly was amazing to see.

It's just the way she doesn't give a f**k killing all those monster live in front of thousands of people is so... refreshing(?) she barely hesitates executing them, mourning a little bit after the kill and then just move on... It's quite hard for me to believe she wasn't aware about the spare choice, heck she probably did no mercy route just to make the backseaters suffer lol she embodies the necromancer role to the *bone*. I won't even be surprise if she does G-route next, I'll be hopping the ride for sure.

That Sans moment should've emotionally hit her hard, because she naturally (as in no one spoiled her) experiences the consequences and all that EXP, LV, etc.

Undertale is definitely a 50-50 game for live-streaming; on one hand it's interesting to see people's genuine reaction, on the other hand streamers who can't help themselves would get entangled with backseaters, meaning there's a high chance of the streamer spoiling their own personal experience of playing the game.

Ugznw9Y8E5kMm2UA4d54AaABAg,1617235200,tuukka aro,660,"This stream really shows why playing Undertale your own way is important. At the end Rushia describes how she felt incredible emotion when the game admonished her for the choices she made, which makes sense because they really were hers. She didn't let others dictate what do to and got a lot more effected by the game as a result. 

She said she really was shaken when Sans told her to ""go to hell"". A strong feeling she would have missed out on completely if she didn't play her own way."
Ugznw9Y8E5kMm2UA4d54AaABAg.9Jzhl5BWJEW9JzjMLsvWna,1617235200,Bright,20,The real question is did she know how to spare them?

Ugznw9Y8E5kMm2UA4d54AaABAg.9Jzhl5BWJEW9Jzjm2WPMiz,1617235200,Tenchua,76," @Bright  maybe yes, but maybe she also thought that she needed exp to grow stronger like any other rpg"
Ugznw9Y8E5kMm2UA4d54AaABAg.9Jzhl5BWJEW9Jzjsy2lFz9,1617235200,tuukka aro,48," @Bright  Whether or not she did, finding out won't feel as satisfying if she doesn't figure it out herself."
Ugznw9Y8E5kMm2UA4d54AaABAg.9Jzhl5BWJEW9JzmK-8BlNM,1617235200,Aer0z,40," @Bright  In my opinion she did, but if you treat Undertale like any other RPG... why would she? Why would she forego free EXP and make later boss fights harder? Why would she flee a battle she could easily win by beating them up? I don’t think anyone could just forget that a button exists on the right side; but if she considers it the same as an “Escape” option of sorts, then there’s no real reason to go through that hassle when viewed from an RPG lens, no?"
Ugznw9Y8E5kMm2UA4d54AaABAg.9Jzhl5BWJEW9JzvZs78anA,1617235200,AdamC,45,"I think Rushia probably got the most out of this game than any other Hololive member. To some degree, the fact that the game originally advertised itself as an RPG where you don't have to kill anyone worked against it being even more shocking/impactful on an individual level; by now many english speaking gamers know the pacifist route is the ""correct"" one before even playing it.

So it's pretty great seeing Rushia play the game with no initial bias, I hope she plays the pacifist route :)"

Ugznw9Y8E5kMm2UA4d54AaABAg.9Jzhl5BWJEW9K-Z5F-uJ-o,1617235200,Cahir Highwind,7," @Aer0z  She didn't. If you watch her fight with Papyrus she actually made it to the part where he is sparing her, but she didn't really get it and proceed to finish him off. Still I agree, that it was definitely enjoyable to watch someone playing the game their own way"
Ugznw9Y8E5kMm2UA4d54AaABAg.9Jzhl5BWJEW9K058VS7wn7,1617235200,Mini scooter,2,yep her reaction to that was what i was waiting for on this normal playthrough
Ugznw9Y8E5kMm2UA4d54AaABAg.9Jzhl5BWJEW9K0XRx9-bf_,1617235200,Salence,4," @Aer0z  The Neutral route is important. Letting players blindly kill monsters for exp was the goal of the game imo. for the first run at least. (and definitely if you don't read the game's steam description). It tries to touch normal RPG players in the feels, and shows you that you can play other ways too."

You really cant be so sure about anything if it comes from Rushia.
She's an expert manipulator that just do things """"wrong"""" just to mess up with her audience.
Her fellow holomembers that aren't close to her is intimidated by Rushia because of this.
Did you notice that she just brush off the ""guilt"" she felt after Sans?"

Ugznw9Y8E5kMm2UA4d54AaABAg.9Jzhl5BWJEW9K2EQTl17Z2,1617235200,Wayward Vector,2,"I mean, I spared toriel because she spared me. You don’t HAVE to play neutral. Stop making it seem like playing a neutral run first is “the best way to get the best experience.” You all are almost as bad as the people who backseat. Not everyone treats games like “a regular rpg.” I never played Pokémon trying to get stronger, my kid self thoroughly enjoyed the character design and music of gen 5. 

TLDR, no route is better. No route “should be done first.” You are not missing out if you start pacifist. And stop circle jerking each other to the 4th wall breaks."
Ugznw9Y8E5kMm2UA4d54AaABAg.9Jzhl5BWJEW9K2KIWOg2ye,1617235200,RedCornix,0, @melchior 01  this likely applies to hololive in general.  It's Likely they are given direction. I'm sure there are internal politics as well but all of this is about as real as reality television.
Ugznw9Y8E5kMm2UA4d54AaABAg.9Jzhl5BWJEW9K2bUlSzKKo,1617235200,StarluckZX,6," @Wayward Vector  there's a difference between doing pacifist first because you want to play pacifist first and playing pacifist first because chat keeps telling you to not kill. its not that she played neutral first, its that she played it mostly the way she wanted to."
Ugznw9Y8E5kMm2UA4d54AaABAg.9Jzhl5BWJEW9KT5Aw4c-Hb,1617235200,Frazzled&White,1,The amount of people in chat trying to ruin the fun of the game everytime a streamer plays Undertale makes my skin crawl. I can't possibly describe the anger I feel at people like that.

The best part was the battle starting 3:22:11, but the most great part was the final battle, when Rushia faced a terrible danmaku.
It seems she didn't played danmaku (bullet hell) like some classic games, but playing these classics like ""Galaga"" or moderns like ""Touhou Project"" would help her at Bullet hells.

The final part was the most terrible about these laughs in Vocoder.

But at least it was ended well.

UgwGuqC2SSyYIvtp0et4AaABAg.9Jzdj0Q3ywC9K0IurtYVue,1617235200,Wafururu,19," @pink  imo they are scared that the streamer might just end it there and not do P route which is understandable but really, you gotta surpress your feeling of selfishness and respect the streamer's decision in their gameplay as a fresh and new player. Self-experience is valuable.

I gotta say I did feel like wanting her to do P route right away but I understand the fact that experience is precious to each and every player on playing any new game. Also, backseating is just rude and rule-breaking as well as those who talk about backseaters on chat.

It happened on my first playthrough; had no better idea about beating Toriel than to wear her down, and when that last hit killed her, I alt-F4'd and hoped I could correct it.

The hint at the beginning was spooky enough, but then Flowey calls you out directly... and suddenly this game goes from ""really clever"" in your mind to ""OMG GET OUT OF MY BRAIN!!!""

There's seriously no better intro to Undertale's underlying meta-mechanics, and when I saw what the basic pacifist dialogue was, I was really underwhelmed. 

Toby seriously knows how to anticipate player behavior and psychology. I remember how freaked out Etika got at times, like he'd stumbled onto the Ben Drowned cartridge or something..."
