UgyGzpOhZ2dxDL_ma8t4AaABAg,1617235200,DRvince07,2,Can someone tell me the technical problem she had from okaeri game that’s why she didn’t play it?
UgyGzpOhZ2dxDL_ma8t4AaABAg.9F4BgqlOGAf9F5--6jczSG,1617235200,Raiden,1,The game isn't well optimized for most PC's. Most indie horror games aren't well optimized. That's why she's had trouble with some while most other games run fine on her PC

UgzXqxY8Tk-bp9kLGGd4AaABAg,1617235200,ApocalypseN04,122,37:31 I like how her auto suggested word after “るしあ” (rushia) is “boingboing”

UgwY5ZjkfSg-7XUkGOJ4AaABAg,1617235200,Nexcell Pride,13,"A Welcome back and an unexpected gameplay instead of programmed due to technical issues, but the problem is not directly the PC or the peripheral configuration...
Some games as ""Pien"", ""Ghost Train"" and ""Okaeri"", between some independant games are not optimized graphically, most possible because programmers made them too faster and they didn't think about all the PCs.

But Rushia-hime didn't throw the towel (As shown as first attempt of ""Ghost Train"" gameplay at August) and played ""Super Smash Bros Ultimate""... At least she invited again to all, and later practiced in another mode. :_ちょうちょ:

And too many shows of affection from LiveChat during ""Supaachaato Orei Time"", which had more time, because yesterday Rushia-hime needed to rest. (According to Twitter, she had dizziness and headaches) but today is OK.

Rushia-hime is more closer to any fan... :_ハート: :_きゅん:
She is OK, we are too... And personally talking, I start the day more happy. :_るんるん:"

UgxkvpHm9XrDqb5ApDl4AaABAg,1617235200,Amai Ta. Yume,4,"I wonder if this is fate or destiny or just plain coincidence. Today, while I was waiting for Rushia, there was a certain problem that came up. I was sad, frustrated and depressed.I didn't know what to do with my life anymore.

	But Rushia saved me again this stream. Just by being there, knowing she's there and streaming with rage, streaming with happiness, with curiosity again I was happy. I cheered for her and I don't want to leave again. 

	When I heard her soft voice that parted from her lips ""只今~ (Tadaima)"", it struct my heart. I was able to cry for the first time in 2 years. I realized how Rushia became an important person in my life. How I was able to feel emotions again. In this dark monotonous world, it's like seeing someone you love but never had met for a long time. When she is not feeling well, I worry, if she is scared, I'm also scared. I don't have the rights, but that's how I always feel. When she's taking care of everyone, I also want to care for her, as long as I can, as much as I want. . . Always

	It may not be the best stream for someone, but it doesn't have to be. This is a stream I'll always remember that I cried and believed in her: Because she is well, because I was miserable and she gave me another happiness and because when I came back to this stream, she's always there. I really love it here, and I really love Rushia.

	Seriously, Thank you Rushia and Hololive. . . I'm glad I jumped into this hole. I'll stay with Rushia as long as she's here, and be one of the people like the fandeads who'll always support her. But even if she's not there, I'll also be one of the person who'll welcome her back, and finally when I graduate, be that person that will always help others like she help me, and help her as well. Forever Grateful.

これは運命ですか、それとも単なる偶然ですか？今日、潤羽るしあを待っていると、ある問題が発生しました。私は悲しく、欲求不満で、落ち込んでいました。私はもう自分の人生をどうしたらいいのかわからなかった。

しかし、ルシアはまた私を救ってくれました。そこにいるだけで、彼女がそこにいることを知り、怒りでストリーミングし、幸せでストリーミングし、再び好奇心を持って私は幸せでした。 私は彼女をサポートし、去りたくありません。「家にいるよ」という優しい声が聞こえたので、2年ぶりに泣きました。それは私の心を打った。潤羽るしあが私の人生で大切な人になったことに気づきました。再び感情を感じることができました。この暗い単調な世界では、それはあなたが愛しているが長い間会ったことがない誰かに会うようなものです。彼女が気分が悪いとき、私は心配します、彼女が怖いなら、私も怖いです。私には権利がありませんが、それは私がいつも感じている方法です。彼女がみんなの世話をするとき、私もできるだけ彼女の世話をしたいです。


誰かにとって最良のストリームではないかもしれませんが、そうである必要はありません。これは私がいつも彼女を泣いて信じていることを覚えているストリームです：彼女は元気だから。私が惨めだったとき、彼女は私に幸せをくれました。私がこのストリームに戻ったとき、彼女はいつもそこにいるからです。私はこの場所が大好きで、ルシアが大好きです。


真剣に、潤羽るしあありがとう。この穴に飛び込んでよかったです。私が働くとき、私はあなたを助ける人になります。


私の願いで、あなたが健康で幸せになることができるように。あなたに感謝します

Always take care Rushia-san! <3 <3 <3
