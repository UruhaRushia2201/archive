 Chúng ta đang sống trong một thời đại văn minh các bạn ạ. Vậy mà vì một cái trend, các bạn vào stream của Rushia để nói những điều thậm tệ với người ta trong khi Rushia còn cảm ơn những người Việt đang xem và ủng hộ cô ấy.
 Các bạn spam, chửi người ta một cách sướng mồm sướng miệng để rồi khi một ai đó chửi lại, lên án, ngăn cản lại những hành động KHỐN NẠN ấy ( cả người Việt và người nước ngoài ) thì các bạn lại bảo chúng tôi đội người nước ngoài lên đầu ?
À vâng, chúng tôi không đội người nước ngoài lên đầu mà chính MẤY THẰNG BỐ LÁO MẤT DẠY CHÚNG MÀY mới đang ngồi lên đầu chúng tôi. 
 Lời này gửi đến các bạn chân thành xin lỗi vì cái đám tự nhục ở trên. Đừng xin lỗi hộ, chửi bới với cái bọn ấy nữa ! Chính những người như chúng ta mới chính là cái tiền đề để bọn bố láo ấy lộng hành. Chúng ta trở thành một cái bia chắn đạn quá chi là hoàn hảo của bọn nó, để rồi lũ không não ấy leo lên đầu chúng ta,
 Chính vì vậy, chúng ta PHẢI im lặng. Hãy report tất cả tụi nó một cách thầm lặng ! Chúng nó là người nói và chúng ta đã vô tình trở thành người nghe của chúng. Vì chẳng có thằng nào nói liên tục trong khi chẳng ai nghe hay đáp lại chúng nó cả !
 Trân trọng gửi đến các bạn Việt Nam.

Mở căng con mắt ra mà đọc nội quy ở description dùm cái.

If you reply to trolls, you are part of the problem.
If you keep apologizing & saying sorry, or feeling shameful for your country, you are part of the problem.
If you tell other people to stop spamming in whatever language, you are part of the problem.
Before telling others how to act, take a mirror & look at your own hypocrisy. It doesn't fking matter whether you type in Vietnamese or English, if it has nothing to do with the content of the stream, then STFU.

Thằng nào troll thì kệ cmn, cứ block hoặc ignore, feed nó nó càng nhây thêm. Mới biết xài internet ah.
Cứ ngồi spam xin lỗi với tự nhục thì cũng chả khá hơn thằng troll bao nhiêu, gây loãn chat + mồi thêm cho đám nước ngoài nó chửi vào mặt.
Mấy chú spam tiếng việt kêu gọi mấy đứa khác đừng spam tiếng việt nữa thì cũng y chang, lấy gương ra soi lại mặt mình xem có khá hơn gì bọn đấy ko. Spam từ đầu đến cuối còn nhiều hơn đám troll.
Nội quy ghi rõ nếu ko liên quan tới nội dung của stream thì đừng chat, ko nói chuyện với nhau, ai viết gì kệ mẹ bọn đấy. Đây là nội quy chung cho stream của Nhật chứ ko như stream của Tây với ta, thích nói chuyện tào lao thì qua Twitch mà tám."

I don't represent anyone, I just have somethings to say
To English viewers: 
Stop saying ""Stop spamming"", a hundred or more of those pops up and it will be just as bad as the spamming
Stop saying ""Ban VN"", a hundred or more of those pops up and it will be just as bad as the spamming
Don't name calling: ""Please ban X/Y/Z"". If you see something inappropriate, scroll back chat and report it yourself. Lend us a hand, after all we are all human, no one can see everything
Spamming ""VN is rude/no manner/terrible"" is not gonna help either, because it scares away legit VNmese people that just happy to be there.
We Vietnamese are used to it. Doesn't mean we won't do anything about it. After all, we brought this upon ourselves too many time
...
..
.
To Vietnamese viewers:
Không cần phải ""Xin lỗi"", người khác spam không phải là lỗi của mọi người
Không cần phải ""Đừng spam nữa"", không thể thay đổi hành vi của một người chỉ bằng dăm ba câu nói. Và cái đó cũng tệ chẳng kém gì spam cả
Không cần hô ""Ban VN đi"", Spam là đủ xấu mặt rồi, không cần vạch áo cao thêm cho người xem lưng. Cộng đồng mạng VN thế nào, người VN hiểu rõ nhất
Chúng ta là người Việt, chúng ta hiểu tiếng Việt. Người xem nói tiếng Anh/Nhật họ chỉ biết có người Việt vào Phá stream thôi, còn chúng ta hoàn toàn có thể chỉ ra đâu là spam, đâu là comment nghiêm túc
Ignore/ Report comment rác
Đừng đôi co với ai 
Nếu muốn comment bằng tiếng Việt, hãy chịu khó dịch tiếng Anh phía sau (Còn nếu ai lười/không biết tiếng Anh, hãy dùng Google Translate)
...
Còn nếu vẫn muốn xin lỗi hay gì đó, hãy để chuyện đó sau buổi stream

​ Monokuma  technically, they're still breaking the rule, there's no reason to chat in anything other than english and japanese. It's not because of discrimination, but those 2 are the easiest for vtubers to interpret and form a meaningful conversation. Chatting in language that they don't understand could only mean you're chatting among yourself - which break the rule - or spamming. Korone can deal with it doesn't mean others can, hence the slow mode rushia did.
This is not a chat room, all viewers should only interact with the streamer, it's the basic form of respect for them and how japan culture works."

1. Read the description. There's no rule stating that the chat must be in only English or Japanese.

2. Just because a group of people were trolling in a previous stream, doesn't mean that everyone from that country are trolls. That's unfair discrimination and it will just create even more problems on top of existing ones.

3. Use the block and report function. No need to reply to trolls. The more your reply, the more people will notice, and the chat will be more cluttered with spam.

I sincerely hope this settles down soon."

P/S: I've found this drama have become from Rushia's nanodesu and speading to those kiddo - and VNese already have tracing skill and found this. And those kiddo are affected by our LoL streamer, toxicl idol/channel, etc ... and only our adult will know what channel in our country, and I must say about our Gen X and Y have teach their child maybe I've say a word ""so disapponted"" (just 4 years ago and I've heard from a mouth of 4-year-old kid just a word ""du ma"" - mean ""motherfker"") so maybe our education of young generation have a debt of apologize to Rushia-chan."
