Also is a great experience... Reviewing papers and sealing if accepted or rejected. Looks like the Flight Agencies, Passport registering (Like any Identification Registering Entity Around the World, i. e., the ""Registro Civil"" in Chile)... Even the Interpol. 

Personally talking... I had an initially complicated, but finally good relationship with the Interpol during my returning flight from U.S.A. My passport was about to expire at the indicated hour and I was saved by the ""captain"". Later of that moment, finally I returned at home. :_なのです:

Returning to the stream review: This gameplay remembered that moment... In that game, It takes a good eye to compare photography, serial numbers, identificatory numbers and expiration date. (I don't know if are more features than described) :_サイリウム碧: :_サイリウム紫:

And returning to the Personally talking... About the 2:57:00 and or 3:00:00, I was mentioned... But I can't find any noticing... Anyway thanks to fandeads at LiveChat about the moment, but I can't find the exact timestamp.
Really I was surprised. :_きゅん: :_ハート:"

Just a month ago, almost every Rushia's video was about 14k.-15k. live, Minecraft about 17k-18k live, but now it's about 11k-13k. Tbh, it really bothers me a lot."
UgwhPub9zNz-CCCfEUh4AaABAg.9GyA4gr1QfI9GyEeJu_57Z,1617235200,Ryokihama,6,My take on this is because society is slowly returning back to normal. So not as many can watch due to having work/school/personal things.

UgwhPub9zNz-CCCfEUh4AaABAg.9GyA4gr1QfI9GyZOVuRvix,1617235200,ADT,1,I think it might be because of the rise of english oriented vtubers like hololive en and other independent vtubers combine with real life issues. Or they fell in genshin impact like me and got burned out. This is actually my first rushia stream in a while and I wish rushia and others to be successful.

Also, don't worry about the Alt-F4 part when the screen became small. It happened to everyone else too. When you click out of the game window, that happens. Resetting the game fixed the issue. I personally don't know how to fix it, but I doubt anyone else in the chat had a better idea. So don't get angry at every small thing. (I'm talking to you, salty chat :P)"
