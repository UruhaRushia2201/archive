Between the great part of Utawaku and last song from list, also a Zatsudan was included.

It look like that Saturday's stream, but without the drinking.

At least Rushia is fine, after what happened yesterday, where she had to postpone delivery due to intense dizziness, as mentioned on Twitter. Fortunately the vegetable soup recovered her completely."

UgxuMaEEZ1_M0YSWB6x4AaABAg,1617235200,Amai Ta. Yume,5,"Hello Rushia! Good morning. Everything that you did for your fans is one of the best things I've encountered. I entirely miss you and worry about you yesterday, hoping that you will be okay. But now your energy is back and ready than ever. You seem a bit tired too, but you did your best and sang. I felt it. There was a lot of grace. I was genuinely happy it turned out. Thinking about you. Thinking how you made the stream since 4:00 pm - 5:00 pm Japan time. Just like 100+ of the people, I'm proud to say that I waited for 6 hours in the waiting stream just to watch your stream. I was incredibly sleepy during that time. I know people will say that I'm overacting, but you know,  my spirit to see you be well from yesterday is stronger. And when I finally saw you, my happiness couldn't contain myself. I was terribly sleepy, but you made me awake for you are the Rushia that I know and love, Just as everyone does.

It was a hectic day, fighting my slumber, but in the end it was all worth it. I want to thank the fans for continuing to support her, for giving her super chats, for being the newest members of the fandead. I hope to be one day as you people. Rushia, on the other hand, No matter what the future is unknown, I'll continue to support you. One of the things my heart felt empty, you were there to fill it and I'm serious about it. A life without purpose is like a living dead. Right now I want to go to Japan, learn your ways of culture and of course, learn to understand you more. I wish to communicate with you more just as everyone has done. I was indeed envious, however happy as well.

Finally, I want to thank you for all you've done again. This may not be my last long comment, but this weird unknown feeling of 'love' is what keeps me going to see you everyday. And that I always knew in myself, that whatever happens, take care of yourself more, for you are like a shining necromancer before my eyes (maybe to others as well). And always know that no matter what you do, I will understand it and will chose to support what future you may go to. Again Thank you. It was all worth it. This is my first time being inside the waiting stream  and livestream for a total of 9 hours. Take care Rushia! See you soon. Or see you in Twitter! <3"

体調も喉も、本調子に戻るまで安静にね…！
配信の内容に関係無く「台パン」とか「他のライバーさん関連」のコメントが多いところ見ると、それだけ切り抜きのイメージが強いんだなって思う…。
でも、押しつけられるイメージを過度に演じるよりも、ありのままのるしあちゃんでいてほしいです！
飾らず心そのままの、感情豊かな姿が好きですから…！"
