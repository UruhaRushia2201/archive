We were worried about Rushia-hime, because according at her Twitter account, she went to Hospital for a checking (Magnetic Resonance), but fortunately she's OK... Even, before starting this stream, she assisted to Inuyama Tamaki-san's 400 Kilo-shock celebration. :_サイリウム碧::_サイリウム紫:

Starting this stream, she told us about today (yesterday in Japan)
And the adventure today was... Carrying Joseph to Dongokuura. We hope Joseph can recognize Pekora-san.
Note: At this time, she changed BGM (Same as New Live2D announcement in mid June 2020 and a Member-only stream of ""Nostalgic Train"")
Later of farewell, changes music again.

Rushia-hime loves adventure and entered at surprise house, and survived to this prank for later give a message. :_きゅん:

Later, in another dimension, Subaru-chan was online and Rushia-hime gave a diamond, but at 1:02:56, Rushia-hime laughs uncontrolably. Later of all, again gives more diamonds to her. 💎

Major part of this stream was the house refurbishing and about Miko-san falling into a trap and killing a zombie named Tamaki-kun.

Another connected at this time: Sheep maiden (Tsunomaki Watame) 

And Supaachaato Orei Time went too longer, at that point of Rushia-hime about to falling asleep during Superchats reading; it was a Naisupa rain.
(Naisupa = Nice Superchat, but Rushia always says ""Aa Supacha Arigatou Gozaimasu"" when she sights any colored message) :_ハート:

Rushia needs resting for now, it was a great Journey. :_るんるん:
Also, Rushia is going more lovely again... And this started after the 500 Kilo-shock stream at early September 2020."
