The translator only translated the negative comments and created a false narrative that Rushia was being hounded by people telling her to end her stream as they wanted to watch the Hololive EN debuts, it seems this was just a small minority of comments.
Those comments were unacceptable, and I am glad that the fandead supported Rushia in the stream, letting her know she should ignore those comments and continue.
Rushia is truly precious, and an absolute angel, the fact that she cared enough about this issue speaks to that."

They must know how to respect and more if they consider themselves fans of her.  Rushia doesn't need you if you think you can claim freely for this.  Being from the Latino community, I feel disappointed by those who asked and claimed in full stream of Rushia.

And this is just my thought but rushia is seriously care about ""Fandead"" since she still give it a very thoughtful moment to tell her thanks for all of her listener since she still want to read the superchat before ending the stream.

translate with google:
あなたの震えている声から、あなたがかなり怖くて混乱しているように見えるので、ルシアにあまり心配しなくてもいいと言えるかどうかわかりません。でも、「次の流れを待つよ...もちろんいつもの元気な声で」と言いたいだけです。そして、これは私の考えに過ぎませんが、ルシアはストリームを終了する前にスーパーチャットを読みたがっているので、彼女はまだすべてのリスナーに感謝を伝えるために非常に思慮深い瞬間を与えているので、「ファンデッド」を真剣に気にしています

Ugxg8FrFtKr56Q0E-j14AaABAg,1617235200,Trucked,124,"Well, I'm kinda happy that the JPN Bros seems to care so much about Holoen (unless it's a bunch of us using Google Translate), but I don't like what happened because of that.

I am more used, like many I presume, to Solo-Streamers. So, in one hand I don't see the big deal with Rushia doing her own thing. People can watch archives later of either of them (Rushia or Heloen). 

On the other hand, this is a company with multiple talents, which means some sort of coordination is expected I guess? for their own interest. So I do understand where these comments come from, but even then there's only that much you can do. Conflicting schedules, miscommunication, being on a different branch, personal issues, time-zones. What happened to ''Shoganai''?!

Personally, like yesterday, if I see a bunch of Hololives streaming at the same time, I just watch my favorite while keeping the others on mute, but with their stream open in a tiny pinned tab in the background in order to give them views. Sometimes maybe I jump from stream to stream.

I mean, you can do this. You're free to manage yourself, it's not her job to manage us. Rushia streaming doesn't block us from watching the Debuts. It didn't block me.

I'm not that into the whole Idol culture, for me they're just Funny/Multi-Talented Streamers. I don't care if someone overlaps someone else, or I don't lose my mind if something like what happened to Towa occurs. So, maybe I don't understand how some people that are into it actually think/feel. I'm ignorant. However, there is a limit of how far you can go, right?

Edit: It seems that the translator OsaKana deliberately blew it out of proportions with his personal flavored translation and dramatic cut-editing. This isn't my opinion, it's what is being said on YouTube and Reddit. There's only one side of the story out for now, but it looks like many have pointed this out and the translator himself took down the video. Disregard the ''incident'' cause there wasn't one."

Heck, I dunno why people complain about it, if it was actually something like her playing still while the others were debuting, it'd be understandable, but if it wasn't? I have no idea why they're even talking. 

 @Recycle Bin  Intentional or not, it was rude ngl. You're asking a STREAMER(Vtuber) to END her STREAM, a lot of problems already with that tbh. Plus, let's be real here, people should one way or another know how others feel, especially something like this which is literally OBVIOUS. There isn't a rule saying that you should make a stream end so you can watch another. It's like asking a band in a live show end because they aren't there to watch them, they're there to watch someone else performing."

どうか一人で抱え込まないで周りに相談してみて？ 三期生のみんなでもマネージャーでもご家族でも、一人で悩んでいるよりも誰かと話すだけでも頭がスッキリすると思う。 私もひどく気分が落ち込んで悩みだらけのとき、頼りになる学校の先輩と話して、落ち込んでた気分が一気に晴れて悩みが解決したことがあったから、るしあちゃんも勇気を出して悩み事とか楽しかった事とか何でも話してみるといいかも！気分が晴れるはず！
