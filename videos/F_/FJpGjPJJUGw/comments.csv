UgztCpOGqbBXNJbOd5B4AaABAg,1617235200,Weird Satay,31,"so this is my pasta of my comment when I saw rushia's clip of this stream when she talked about her MRI procedure and I have rather strong a feeling to communicate this to as many people as possible so here goes.

nee... fellow fandead and others who happen to drop in on the stream, while jokes about rushia boing2 or pettan seems are to stay since she herself entertains it, let's stay away the kind of thoughtless  comments like the time when holoEN debuted and she should stop streaming to accommodate it. Let's be nice to her. as suisei said, we never know when/if they would stop their streaming activity. let's make the stream an environment where vtubers can enjoy doing it and keep doing it for a very very long time."
UgztCpOGqbBXNJbOd5B4AaABAg.9F_NJMJnjPy9FfniqSpje6,1617235200,Zefo No,7,"I do want to clarify the ""comments telling her to stop streaming"" part, because that was proven to be a big translation error and most posts were taken down after.
The commenters didn't tell her to stop streaming, they were just worried about her and asked if it was ok to stream at that time. Since she had a history of getting into trouble with management because she forgot when event streams were happening. She in turn said she was unsure, not upset, if she should continue reading superchats but decided to play it safe.
And also yes, let's not make her genuinely angry."
UgztCpOGqbBXNJbOd5B4AaABAg.9F_NJMJnjPy9Fg-0OvuFcy,1617235200,Nyandere,6,That video was a false translations and edited in a deceiving manner. She was sad that the cafe she worked in part time laid her off so she wasn’t having much irl interactions. That’s why she was talking about how hard it was to communicate. She has already stated she doesn’t mind the pettan or boing boing.
UgwmXeK1jq_GLkbaTBh4AaABAg,1617235200,Nexcell Pride,3,"Definitively Rushia-daitenshi is so admirable. :_きゅん:
Despite the hanging moments due to Satellite falling and various sad endings about tamed rabbits and kitsunes sacrified at moment, this stream is a pure Diamond (I can't say Gold, because the gold is easy to found, better would be platinum or diamonds)
Aditionally, Rushia-daitenshi was so angry and/or sad because these results, along with being attacked by zombies, creepers and golems being without defense, but ending the adventure, her smile returned. 

And about the results of Magnetic Resonance, she told us about it at Supaachaato Orei Time... She has low blood pressure...
Personally talking, I also have this condition, but the only difference is that the case of Rushia-daitenshi is congenital, I have low blood pressure due to various conditions both external as polymetals exposure, such as internal as when my sugar level drops down. That causes intense headaches... Well, I explained one time when thanks to one of Rushia's ASMR at September, my headache has dissapeared. 
Well, returning to her, the only tip is about to drinking water before streaming, and avoid some foods like cheese or chocolate (Or eating until 70 g., chocolate is good for heart)

Special mention was the Hearts Tsunami in three ocassions during ""Supaachaato Orei Time"" :_ハート:

Definitively Rushia-daitenshi is more closer to her audience and we must please her. :_ちょうちょ:"

・体に循環を与えろと言われた

UgwCxiHCnhC6Uxq96Rt4AaABAg,1617235200,Amai Ta. Yume,107,"IT was a fun yet tragic stream. Killed by the golemn, having your black usagis died(peko) and not finding the main reason you entered mincraft in the first place. But don't worry! You can find White Fox soon. Just believe in yourself Rushia! The superchat was great! There are some hindrances here and there (sorry for my Nationality for doing something bad). but the whole super chat reading was so lovely and fun! Thanks Rushia for sending love and doing your best to understand us! I'll make sure here that I can understand Nihonggo so that I can also understand you in your native language.

Thank you EN bros for the support! I hope you have a great day after this stream.

Thank you JP bros for your loving support to Rushia! 

And Thank you Redan for the season continuation! Make sure not to overstep anything, but your season 4 shall continue! XD"

What does it mean actually?
Season 3? Is there season 1 or two? Or i missing something?"
UgwCxiHCnhC6Uxq96Rt4AaABAg.9FZKvjT2CEc9F_J2dgOOIz,1617235200,Redan Kenneth Uy,0," @steven phoenix  I planned to do a solo red sc raid on Halloween which is also my birthday. On that night, I was surprised that youtube won't let me do the 5th red superchat and says I have to do it tomorrow. It will only allow me 4 red superchats. So, I have no choice but to divide them in 4 red superchats on every livestream starting on Halloween. I decide to call them seasons and made a topic for each since it's not one straight conversation anymore."
